# EvilHangman
Implements a game of Evil Hangman.

This program impelements a game of Evil Hangman. I wrote the class HangmanManager.java that supports HAngmanMain.java and the other relevant files. In a game of Evil Hangman, a computer delays picking a word until it is forced to rather than choosing a word at the beginning in normal hangman. Thus, the computer is always considering a set of words that could be the answer. It fools the user into thinking they are playing fairly, as the computer only considers words with the same letter pattern.
